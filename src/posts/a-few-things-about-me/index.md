The following will probably be moved to some sort of an about page as this site matures,
but right now I thought it was suitable to keep it as a blog post!

The photograph you see featured in this post is taken from one of my proudest moments.
There I am in the center, in the zone; competing in the finals in what would pass as Iceland's "Battle of the bands"
or Músíktilraunir (Music Experiments), which is hosted annually in Reykjavík's concert hall Harpa.

Now why am I bringing this up and why do I consider this such a significant achievement? I didn't even win...
Because less than a year prior to this evening I didn't even play bass...

### Few Years Later
