I had a teacher once that could tell you exactly what was wrong with your car simply
by listening to your vocal imitiation of it. This was fascinating to me; to have so much experience
within a field to be able to so instinctively pin-point a problem. What a wizard he was.

### Fast forward a couple of years

I ended up in Gothenburg on by you could say; I was just going to get a job somewhere.

Programming was one of countless things I tried out; figured I didn't really like, and promptly
dropped. I was also convinced that I was hardly smart enough to be a programmer for a living, this was stuff for prodigies!

### Creative freedom in a logical environment

In programming there

### One day is never the same

I have a hard time with repetitive tasks and being a developer makes sure that the tasks that you run into always require a new perspective, keeping your wits sharp

### Thirst for knowledge

The world of tech is a bottomless pit of information. There are so many different topics within the profession and innovation always stacks more things to learn on top of it. You won't be getting bored any time soon

### So why did I become a developer?

- Find your flow
- Don't let inexperience scare you
- Be persistent
